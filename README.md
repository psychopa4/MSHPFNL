# [A Progressive Fusion Generative Adversarial Network for Realistic and Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9279273)
This work is based on [PFNL](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Yi_Progressive_Fusion_Video_Super-Resolution_Network_via_Exploiting_Non-Local_Spatio-Temporal_Correlations_ICCV_2019_paper.html) by [Yi et al.](https://github.com/psychopa4/PFNL)
This is the TensorFlow version, and PyTorch version will be available.

## Datasets
We have selected [MM522 dataset](https://github.com/psychopa4/MMCNN) for training and collected another 20 sequences for evaluation, and in consider of copyright, the datasets should only be used for study.

The datasets can be downloaded from Google Drive and Baidu Drive, [train](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xPMYiA0JwtUe9GKiUa4m31XvDPnX7Juu) and [eval,test,checkpoint](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TNtkn_dHHQf_3_JABKWgZg) (password: pr7p).

Note that the [training](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xPMYiA0JwtUe9GKiUa4m31XvDPnX7Juu) dataset provides Ground Truth images and Bicubic downsampling LR images, while the [eval](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TNtkn_dHHQf_3_JABKWgZg) (password: pr7p) dataset provides Gaussian blur and downsampling images. Thus, please refer to ./model/base_model.py for generating Gaussian blur and downsampling images from Ground Truth images.

Unzip the training dataset to ./data/train/ and evaluation dataset to ./data/val/ .

## Environment
  - Python (Tested on 3.6)
  - Tensorflow (Tested on 1.12.0)
